- There are two typos in Equation (1.5):
=> The first term in the left-hand side, $\vec{F}_2$, should be $F_2$ (no vector sign).
=> More importantly, the right is wrong on the right-hand side: it should be $F_1 \cos \alpha$, not $-F_1 \cos \alpha$. [Thank you to Nishant Gaurav for pointing this out]
The incorrect sign is clear: if there is a mass on the inclined plane, then $F_2$ must be larger than $M g$ to make up for the extra force of gravity.

- There are multiple misspelled words, but keeping track of those is not necessary.
